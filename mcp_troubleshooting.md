# MCP Troubleshooting Guide
This guide addresses common issues encountered when implementing and using the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) for climate research applications.
## Connection Issues
### Server Connection Failures
**Symptoms:**
-
"Connection refused" errors
- Timeout when connecting to the server
-
"Server not initialized" errors
**Possible Causes and Solutions:**
1.
**Server not running**
- Ensure the server script is running
- Check for errors in the server console output
- Verify the server process hasn't crashed
2.
**Incorrect server path**
- Verify the path to the server script is correct
- Ensure the script has execute permissions
3.
**Port conflicts**
- Check if another process is using the same port (for HTTP/SSE transport)
- Try a different port in the configuration
4.
**Network issues**
- Verify network connectivity
- Check firewall settings
### Initialization Failures
**Symptoms:**
-
"Failed to initialize" errors
-
"Protocol version mismatch" errors
**Possible Causes and Solutions:**
1.
**Version incompatibility**
- Ensure client and server are using compatible MCP versions
- Update both client and server to the latest version
2.
**Missing dependencies**
- Verify all required packages are installed
- Check for package version conflicts
3.
**Configuration errors**
- Verify the server configuration is correct
- Check for syntax errors in configuration files
## Tool Execution Issues
### Tool Not Found
**Symptoms:**
-
"Tool not found" errors
-
"Unknown tool" errors
**Possible Causes and Solutions:**
1.
**Tool not registered**
- Verify the tool is properly registered with the server
- Check for typos in tool names
2.
**Tool registration timing**
- Ensure tools are registered before the server starts
3.
**Case sensitivity**
- Check if tool names are case-sensitive in your implementation
### Tool Execution Failures
**Symptoms:**
-
"Tool execution failed" errors
- Timeouts during tool execution
- Unexpected tool results
**Possible Causes and Solutions:**
1.
**Invalid arguments**
- Verify the arguments passed to the tool are valid
- Check for type mismatches (e.g., string vs. integer)
- Ensure all required arguments are provided
2.
**External API failures**
- Check if the tool depends on external APIs that might be down
- Verify API keys and authentication
3.
**Resource limitations**
- Check if the tool requires resources that are not available
- Monitor memory and CPU usage during execution
4.
**Exception handling**
- Improve error handling in tool implementations
- Add more detailed logging to identify the exact failure point
## LLM Integration Issues
### Model API Errors
**Symptoms:**
-
"API key not valid" errors
-
"Rate limit exceeded" errors
-
"Model not available" errors
**Possible Causes and Solutions:**
1.
**API key issues**
- Verify API keys are correct and not expired
- Check if the API key has the necessary permissions
2.
**Rate limiting**
- Implement rate limiting and retries in your client
- Consider upgrading your API plan for higher limits
3.
**Model availability**
- Verify the requested model is available from the provider
- Check if the model name is correct
### Tool Calling Issues
**Symptoms:**
- LLM not using available tools
- Incorrect tool arguments
- Multiple redundant tool calls
**Possible Causes and Solutions:**
1.
**Tool description issues**
- Improve tool descriptions to make their purpose clearer
- Ensure parameter descriptions are clear and accurate
2.
**System prompt issues**
- Adjust the system prompt to encourage tool use
- Provide examples of tool usage in the prompt
3.
**Model capabilities**
- Verify the model supports function/tool calling
- Consider using a more capable model
4.
**JSON parsing issues**
- Ensure the LLM is generating valid JSON for tool arguments
- Implement robust JSON parsing with error handling
## Performance Issues
### Slow Response Times
**Symptoms:**
- Long waiting times for responses
- Timeouts during complex operations
**Possible Causes and Solutions:**
1.
**Inefficient tool implementations**
- Optimize tool implementations for performance
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
2.
**Network latency**
- Reduce the number of network requests
- Implement request batching where possible
3.
**Large conversation history**
- Implement conversation history truncation
- Summarize or compress older messages
4.
**Resource constraints**
- Monitor memory and CPU usage
- Consider scaling up resources or implementing load balancing
### Memory Leaks
**Symptoms:**
- Increasing memory usage over time
- Server crashes after extended operation
**Possible Causes and Solutions:**
1.
**Unclosed resources**
- Ensure all resources (files, connections, etc.) are properly closed
- Implement proper cleanup in exception handlers
2.
**Accumulating data structures**
- Implement size limits for caches and buffers
- Periodically clean up unused data
3.
**Background tasks**
- Ensure background tasks are properly managed and terminated
- Implement proper task cancellation
## Security Issues
### Unauthorized Access
**Symptoms:**
- Unexpected tool calls
- Access from unknown sources
**Possible Causes and Solutions:**
1.
**Missing authentication**
- Implement proper authentication for all endpoints
- Verify API keys or tokens on each request
2.
**Insufficient authorization**
- Implement role-based access control
- Restrict tool access based on user roles
3.
**CORS issues**
- Configure proper CORS settings for web clients
- Restrict allowed origins to trusted domains
### Data Leakage
**Symptoms:**
- Sensitive data appearing in logs
- Unexpected data in responses
**Possible Causes and Solutions:**
1.
**Insufficient input validation**
- Implement thorough input validation
- Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks
2.
**Overly verbose error messages**
- Avoid including sensitive information in error messages
- Implement appropriate error handling
3.
**Logging issues**
- Configure logging to exclude sensitive data
- Implement log redaction for sensitive fields
## Debugging Tips
1.
**Enable detailed logging**
- Set logging level to DEBUG for more information
- Log key events and data flows
2.
**Inspect network traffic**
- Use tools like Wireshark or browser developer tools
- Monitor requests and responses between components
3.
**Isolate components**
- Test components in isolation to identify issues
- Use mock objects to simulate dependencies
4.
**Check system resources**
- Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage
- Look for resource constraints or contention
5.
**Review recent changes**
- Identify recent code or configuration changes
- Consider reverting changes to isolate the issue
